## **Context For Taekwondo School Test Score Analysis**
1. *Test Scale:* Student tests are graded on a 5 point scale where **5.0 is the highest score** and **2.0 is a passing score**
2. *Poomsae:* Combinations of striking or blocking techniques and stances students must memorize for testing at each rank
3. *Kicking Techniques:* Each belt rank has a set of kicking techniques that are individually graded
4. *Kick Average:* Average of all scores for a particular student's kicks

## [Beginner Taekwondo Belt Promotion Test Score Analysis March 2023](https://github.com/kykashi/Python-Projects/blob/main/White_Belt_3.25_Data_Exploration.md)
- Used MS Excel, Python, and Tableau to analyze belt promotion testing for beginning white belt students
- Combined test score data with internal school data to identify student ID #s and scores
- White Belts scored proficiently on Poomsae and Poomsae components
- White Belts excel at the Front Kick and need to work on the reverse cresecent kick
- The Roundhouse kick is the runner up for best kick, encouraging because this is the most mechanically difficult technique
- Lessons in the coming months will focus on Poomsae stances, which received the lowest average score
